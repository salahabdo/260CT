Case Study – Sphere Booking and Check-in (SBC) System
Introduction

The Sphere is a new indoor artificial snow ski-slope in the Midlands. Skiers can book sessions to use the
slope. Each day is divided into a number of one-hour sessions. At the moment, the company have a slow
inflexible Booking and Check-in System that needs replacing. It is currently considering an electronic booking
system to manage their business. The following outlines the required functionality for the Booking and Checkin
System.

Requirements for the Booking and Check-in System
Customers can phone in, or come to the front desk to make all session bookings, registrations, etc through a
slope operator.

The slope operator can book a session on behalf of a user. If the user is a first-time user of the slope, then this
includes adding the user to the register. At the same time, the user can choose to be registered as a member
as well. As part of the booking task, the slope operator will see the slope schedule and the details of the user.
If the user is a novice, then the user can choose to be booked into a session with an instructor.
The user can be registered as a new member at any time (without having to make booking), but a new
member must already be a registered user.

If a skier wishes to join as a member, the membership fee is required. There are currently two types of
membership, the free basic membership and the loyalty membership with an annual fee. A member with the
basic membership can be upgraded to the loyalty membership after booking at least 10 sessions.
A skier pays a different fee for each standard session (without an instructor) or training session (with an
instructor) when the booking is made. Only loyalty members get a lower rate for standard sessions or training
sessions. The system does not handle these payments, but needs to know what the payment should be.
When users arrive for their ski session, a slope operator uses the system to perform the check-in task. The
slope operator enters the skier’s user id and the system displays details of the user and any matching booking
(including the charge to be made). The slope operator then confirms whether this is the right booking.
A ski instructor can get a list of people to be expected in their booked sessions.

The manager can add and delete sessions. Details of a session may include whether an instructor is booked,
and the list of users have been booked in the session. The manager can also make additions and changes to
the list of instructors employed by the company.

The company would also like the software team to develop new features in addition to those
mentioned above, which would help them improve the running of their business.
